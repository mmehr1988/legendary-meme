Assignment: Weather Dashboard

Developer: Mehdi Mehrabani

For this week, we were tasked with building a Weather Dashboard that allows a user to look up the current weather for any city. The main purpose of this assignment was to further enhance our knowledge of Server-Side APIs and using localStorage to store any persistent data.

In the week prior, we learned how to use the Fetch API method to access API data.

1. Definition of Fetch API per MDN Web Docs:

> "The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses. It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy, logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network."

MDN Web Docs link [Using Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)

The two links below were provided to read prior to beginning the assignment.

1. Overview of how to use API keys. [Full-Stack Blog on how to use API keys](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/how-to-use-api-keys)

2. Specifics when retrieving data from OpenWeather API. [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api)
